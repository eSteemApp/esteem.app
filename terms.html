        <h1>9. Account Registration</h1>
        <p>9.1. You need not use an eSteem Account. If you wish to use an Account, you must create an Account with eSteem to access the Services (“Account”). When you create an Account, you are strongly advised to take the following precautions, as failure to do so may result in loss of access to, and/or control over, your Wallet: (a) Create a strong password that you do not use for any other website or online service; (b) Provide accurate and truthful information; (c) Maintain and promptly update your Account information; (d) maintain the security of your Account by protecting your Account password and access to your computer and your Account; (e) Promptly notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your Account.</p>
        <p>9.2. You hereby accept and acknowledge that you take responsibility for all activities that occur under your Account and accept all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access to your Account, to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>
        <h1>10. The eSteem Services</h1>
        <p>10.1. As described in more detail below, the Services, among other things, provide in-browser (or otherwise local) software that (a) generates and stores STEEM ACCOUNT Addresses and encrypted Private Keys (defined below), and (b) Facilitates the submission of STEEM transaction data to the Steem network without requiring you to access the STEEM command line interface.</p>
        <p>10.2. Account Names and Private Keys. When you create an Account, the Services generate and store a cryptographic private and public key pair that you may use to send and receive STEEM and Steem Dollars via the Steem network.. The Private Key uniquely matches the Account Name and must be used in connection with the Account Name to authorize the transfer of STEEM and Steem Dollars from that Account. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your Private Key and any password phrase associated with your wallet. You must keep your Account, password phrase and Private Key access information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of Steem, Steem Power and Steem Dollars associated with the Wallet.</p>
        <p>10.3. No Password Retrieval. eSteem does not receive or store your Account password, nor the unencrypted keys and addresses. Therefore, we cannot assist you with Account password retrieval. The Services cannot generate a new password for your Account. You are solely responsible for remembering your Account password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any Account Names and password pairs maintained in your Account, you accept and acknowledge that any STEEM, Steem Dollars and Steem Power you have associated with such Account will become inaccessible if you do not have your Account password.</p>
        <p>10.4. Transactions. In order to be completed, all proposed Steem transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Steem public ledger via the Steem distributed consensus network (a peer-to-peer economic network that operates on a cryptographic protocol), which is not owned, controlled or operated by eSteem. The Steem Network is operated by a decentralized network of independent third parties. Blockchain has no control over the Steem network and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction details you submit via the Services will be confirmed via the Steem network. You acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit via the Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Steem network. You may use the Services to submit these details to the network.</p>
        <p>10.5. No Storage or Transmission of STEEM, Steem Dollars or Steem Power. Steem, in any of its forms (STEEM, Steem Dollars and Steem Power) is an intangible, digital asset. They exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained in the Steem network. The Service does not store, send or receive Steem. Any transfer of title that might occur in any STEEM, Steem Dollars or Steem Power occurs on the decentralized ledger within the Steem network and not within the Services. We do not guarantee that the Service can effect the transfer of title or right in any Steem, Steem Dollars or Steem Power.</p>
        <p>10.6. Relationship. Nothing in these Terms is intended to nor shall create any partnership, joint venture, agency, consultancy or trusteeship, you and eSteem being with respect to one another independent contractors.</p>
        <p>10.7. Accuracy of Information. You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept and acknowledge that eSteem is not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any Steem transaction initiated via the Services, for instance, if you mistype an Account Name or otherwise provide incorrect information. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before completing them via the Services.</p>
        <p>10.8. No Cancellations or Modifications. Once transaction details have been submitted to the Steem network via the Services, The Services cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction details. eSteem has no control over the Steem Network and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests.</p>
        <p>10.9. Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions you for which you have submitted transaction details via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that eSteem is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Steem transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding or remitting any taxes arising from any Steem transactions.</p>

        <h1>24. Arbitration</h1>
        <p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES WITH ESTEEM AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM ESTEEM.</p>
        <h4>24.1. Binding Arbitration</h4>
        <p>Except for disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and eSteem: (a) waive your right to have any and all disputes or Claims arising from these Terms or eSteem (collectively, “Disputes“) resolved in a court; and (b) waive your right to a jury trial. Instead, you and eSteem will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it, instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).</p>
        <h4>24.2. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions</h4>
        <p>YOU AND ESTEEM AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE IS PERSONAL TO YOU AND ESTEEM AND THAT ANY SUCH DISPUTE WILL BE RESOLVED SOLELY THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND WILL NOT BE BROUGHT AS A CLASS ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

FURTHER, YOU AND ESTEEM AGREE THAT A DISPUTE CANNOT BE BROUGHT AS A CLASS, OR OTHER TYPE OF REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, WHETHER WITHIN OR OUTSIDE OF ARBITRATION, OR ON BEHALF OF ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS.</p>
        <h4>24.3. Federal Arbitration Act</h4>
        <p>You and eSteem agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 24 shall be governed by, construed and enforced, both substantively and procedurally, by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “FAA”) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
        <h4>24.4. Process</h4>
        <p>You and eSteem agree that you will notify each other in writing of any Dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises so that the parties can attempt, in good faith, to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to eSteem shall be provided by sending an email to info@esteem.ws. Your notice must include: (1) your name, postal address and email address; (2) a description of the nature or basis of the Dispute; and (3) the specific relief that you are seeking. If you and eSteem cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days of eSteem receiving the notice, either you or eSteem may, as appropriate pursuant to this Section 24, commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in court. You and eSteem agree that any arbitration or claim must be commenced or filed within one (1) year after the Dispute arose; otherwise, you and eSteem agree that the claim is permanently barred (which means that you will no longer have the right to assert a claim regarding the Dispute). You and eSteem agree that: (a) any arbitration will occur in San Francisco County, California; (b) arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; and (c) the state or federal courts in California will have exclusive jurisdiction over the enforcement of an arbitration award and over any Dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration.

        <h4>24.5. Authority of Arbitrator</h4>
        <p>As limited by the FAA, these Terms and applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have: (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute; and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’ s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>
        <h4>24.6. Rules of JAMS</h4>
        <p>The rules of, and additional information about, JAMS are available on the JAMS website at http://www.jamsadr.com/, as may be updated from time to time. By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either: (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS; or (b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>
